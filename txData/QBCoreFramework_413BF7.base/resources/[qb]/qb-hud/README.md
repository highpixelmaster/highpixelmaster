# lj-hud used with QBCore Framework

My qb-hud edit. Before you drone on about Pepe-HUD similarites, yes, there is parts of it in here. However, I've already gotten permission from the original developer.
I don't fucking care for drama. Shut up and use it or don't idc.

Runs at ~ 6 to 8 ms I can't be bothered to optimize more I will later on
